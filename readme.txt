== Installation ==

Installation of Twitter Search is rather straightforward.

1. Upload the `twitter-search-for-wp` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

3. Hop over to the Widgets tab and add a Twitter Search Widget.
4. Customize the options for the widget.

== Using Twitter Search in Pages or Posts with Shortcodes ==

To use Twitter Search as a shortcode, drop the following into your page or post and customize the variables.

[twitter_search query="upthemes" show="40" custom_css="yes"]

"query" is where you should enter the exact query you want to be run as a Twitter Search.
"show" is where you enter how many tweets to show.
"custom_css" is where you can tell it you want to use custom CSS or the default CSS that comes with the plugin.

When embedding the shortcode version of Twitter Search, you should keep in mind that if you are using another one in the sidebar with the default CSS applied, that same CSS will be applied to your shortcoded version as well.
